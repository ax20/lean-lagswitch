# Lean
A simple, lightweight lag switch I created for fun which utilizes [netsh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-contexts) commands on Windows to throttle your network. I wrote this program initially to get away with skipping certain parts of online classes to go grab snacks from my refrigerator, as I could simulate high latency, and lag.

## Skills/Experience
Small projects like this help me gain a better understand of how to certain things work together, in this case [managed languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code) and [command languages](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandl.htm) and how to utilize it effectively.
- Building GUI Interfaces in Java using [WindowBuilder](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/)
- Understanding Windows command line commands
- Scripting
## Usage
This program is depandant on Windows as the main function works uses the Windows Command line. 

To run this program you can download the [compiled version](https://github.com/C403G/Lean/releases) of this project is available for download, and is ready to run out of the box. If you cannot double-click run the file, you can execute via the command below or use a third-party application that fixes this issue automatically called [JarFix by Johann N.
